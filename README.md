# Sea Battle - Pygame Project

## Made by Symon Bezerra and Matheus Alexandre

### The following repository is a Pygame implementation of the classic Sea Battle game. This version uses a regular 10x10 board, where a player plays against a CPU. Sadly, no AI was implemented, so the CPU only fires random shots.

### The idea came from a project made for school, as a semester ending submission for the Algorithm subject. Initially, it was all done using the text-based terminal (a very frustating form of work, by the way). Then, when we found out that Pygame use was actually allowed, I decided to re-implement the game more "properly".

# Matheus had no active collaboration in this re-implementation, but he takes the credit for making most of the original board methods.
